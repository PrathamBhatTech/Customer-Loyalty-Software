# Customer-Loyalty-Software

Our problem statement is to develop an end-to-end “Customer Loyalty Software” that targets customer retention and acquisition. Businesses all around the world struggle with the universal problem of customer loyalty and keeping an adequate market share in their industry. The lack of a personalised experience and failure to meet unique individual preferences are some of the causes of this decline that businesses are seeing. 

There is a dire need for businesses to implement Customer Loyalty Software at their respective business levels, which allows them to provide a seamless and personalised loyalty program management system. A business can simply make use of this customer loyalty software and implement the same with regards to their business, helping them to increase revenue, customer acquisition and retention, and gain a competitive edge in the market. 

This implementation of a customer loyalty software makes use of the Model View Controller architectural pattern. The usage of MVC architecture splits the entire codebase/ logic into three distinct parts, being, Model, View, and Controller.

Model: The model represents the data and business logic of the application.
View: The view represents the presentation layer of the application and handles the user interface.
Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, receiving and processing user input, updating the Model, and updating the View accordingly.

## Customer Loyalty Software Explanation: 

The entire customary loyalty software takes on a points-and-tier approach. Customers are awarded points for every transaction made by them, these points are proportional to the total transaction amount.  The points accumulated by a particular customer are used to determine the various “tiers” of loyalty that they can belong to, tiers such as “silver, gold, and platinum”. The higher the tier of a particular customer, the more their loyalty, and hence a higher privilege can be given to the in terms of discounts, offers, and rewards in a manner deemed appropriate to the business. Members of higher tiers also avail bonus points on the basis of their loyalty towards a particular business. Customers can then choose to claim these points during their transaction or can choose to accumulate these points to avail of a larger reward at a later time.  

 Our problem statement was to create a fully functional customer loyalty software which takes into account the various purchases made by users(here, customers) to award them points. Points are awarded to the customer in proportion to the total transaction amount by the customer at the client’s shop. Based on the total amount of points awarded to the customer, they would be placed into various “loyalty tiers”. The higher the “tier” of a particular customer, the more privileged they would be in terms of discounts, offers, rewards and overall customer service. Members of higher tiers may get bonus points on transactions for their loyalty towards the store.
